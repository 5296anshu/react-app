1):- What is React?

Ans:- React is the most popular javascript library for building user interfaces. 
It is fast, flexible and it also has a strong community sitting online to help you every time. 
The coolest thing about React is it’s based on components, you break down your complex code into individual pieces i.e components and that helps developers in organizing their code in a better way. 
A lot of companies are moving to React and that’s the reason most of the beginners and experienced developers also expanding their knowledge learning this library. 

2):- Who made React?
Ans:- React was created by Jordan Walke, a software engineer at Facebook.
What is Babel?
Ans:- Babel is a toolchain that is mainly used to convert ECMAScript 2015+ code into a backwards compatible version of JavaScript in current and older browsers or environments. Here are the main things Babel can do for you:

Transform syntax
Polyfill features that are missing in your target environment (through a third-party polyfill such as core-js)
Source code transformations (codemods)
And more! (check out these videos for inspiration)

3):- How does Babel convert html code in React into valid code?

Ans:- Babel converts HTML code into valid code by using the JSX code and converter.

A user can essentially use future JavaScript in the browsers of today thanks to Babel, a very well-known transpiler.
The standard method has the ability to accurately translate the newest JavaScript code into a format that the browser can properly understand.
Babel is a key tool that can translate JSX syntax, which is used to create HTML-like code in React components, into valid JavaScript code that can be executed in preferred browsers.
By converting the JSX code into JavaScript functions that return the same HTML-like structures.
The functionality then enables the usage of JSX in React apps and ensures compatibility with outdated browsers that might not support the most recent JavaScript syntax.

4):- What is ReactDOM used for? Write an example?

   ReactDOM is used to render components and elements on the web. It is a part of the React library used to create user interfaces and dynamic web applications, 
   as well as reusable and composable components that can be used in different applications.

   It is used to interact and manipulate the DOM structure, including the elements and components that are rendered on the page. 
   It’s also used to control the state of the components and elements on the page. ReactDOM also provides developers with access to the DOM APIs.

6):- How do you add react to a web application?

   Add React in few step.
    Step 1: Add a DOM Container to the HTML. First, open the HTML page you want to edit. ...
    Step 2: Add the Script Tags. Next, add three <script> tags to the HTML page right before the closing </body> tag: ...
    Step 3: Create a React Component. Create a file called like_button.js next to your HTML page.

7):- What is React.createElement?
     React.createElement is a fundamental method of React JS. The main use of React.createElement is the Creation of a React component. It is the JavaScript format for creating react components. Also, the JSX react component when transpired invokes this only method for creating the component.

    Syntax:
       React.createElement(type,{props},children); 
  // JSX code 
      <type {props} >{children}</type
       Parameters: React.createElement() takes three arguments. They are:

    1) type: the type of the HTML element (h1,p, button, etc).
    2) props: properties of the object({style:{size:10px}} or Eventhandlers, classNames,etc).
    3) children: anything that needs to be enclosed by that component.
    4)   React DOM: React DOM contains the arguments that are necessary to render react elements in the browser.
 
    ReactDOM.render(element,containerElement);
     Parameters: ReactDOM.render() takes two arguments:
     element: The element that needs to be rendered in the DOM.
     containerElement: Where to render in the dom.

8):- What are the three properties that createElement accept?
 Ans: The Three properties of createElement are:
  1) appendChild(), insertBefore(), replaceChild(): Methods to manipulate the child nodes of the element.
  2) addEventListener(): Attaches an event handler to the element.
     So, while createElement() itself only accepts the tag name, you can subsequently manipulate the element using these properties and methods to achieve your desired outcome.
  3)`innerHTML: Sets or returns the HTML content (inner HTML) of an element.

9):- What is the meaning of render and root?
    1) Render: In web development, "render" typically means to generate the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript necessary to display a web page or a part of a web page to the user. This process involves taking data and UI components and transforming them into a visual representation that users can interact with. Rendering can happen on the client-side (in the user's web browser) or on the server-side (where the web server generates the HTML before sending it to the client).

    2) Root: "Root" usually refers to the top-level element in a component-based web application framework, such as React or Vue.js. The root element is where the entire application is mounted or attached to in the HTML document. It serves as the entry point for the application's UI hierarchy. For example, in React applications, you might see something like <div id="root"></div>, where the root element with the id "root" is the container for the entire React application.
